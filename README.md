# Split

Have you ever had a great brunch date with your friends? You were talking and laughing... but then, the bill came! Oh no, how we're gonna divide this? We can't ask to split the check because there are 10 people here and many dishes were shared among different people. The waiter will hate us!

This is why I present to you - **Split**!

Split allows you to upload your receipt to the app and add people to dishes/items that they ordered. Then, Split will automatically calculate the total for each individual, and yes, with tax and tips included.

Say no to the bill splitting headache we all face at the end of your lovely meal. Let Split do it for you!
